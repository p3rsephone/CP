# CP

Project for CP, in which we were introduced to point free programming in Haskell by solving a series of exercises.
If you still want to know more, like in what consisted the problems, or how the hell we solved them, check *all* of the details (in Portuguese) [here](https://github.com/p3rsephone/CP/blob/master/cp1617t.pdf).

But really, it was a class effort.
